# consumer-loan-assistant

Problem statement : (Ever wonder just) How much those credit card accounts are costing you ?

Abstract : This project will help you get a handle on consumer debt. 
The Consumer Loan Assistant Project you would build computes payments and loan terms given balance and interest information.
We look at focus traversal among controls, how to do input validation, and the message box for user feedback.

In this project, we will build a consumer loan assistant. You input a loan balance and yearly interest
rate. You then have two options: (1) enter the desired number of payments and the loan assistant
computes the monthly payment, or (2) enter the desired monthly payment and the loan assistant
determines the number of payments you will make. An analysis of your loan, including total of
payments and interest paid is also provided.
